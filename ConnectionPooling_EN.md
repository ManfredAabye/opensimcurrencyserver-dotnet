# ðŸ”„ What Is Connection Pooling?

**Connection pooling** means that database connections are not created and destroyed for every access, but are instead temporarily stored in a pool.  
When an application needs a connection, it receives a free one from the pool. If none are available, a new one is created (up to the maximum limit).  
After use, the connection is not closed but returned to the pool.

This leads to:

- **Faster access**: Opening and closing connections is expensive; pooling saves time and resources.
- **More efficient resource usage**: Only as many connections as needed are maintained.
- **Scalability**: The application can handle many parallel requests without keeping unnecessary connections open.

## ðŸ”§ What Has Changed in the MoneyServer?

### Before:
- On startup, 20, 50, or even 700 database connections were **statically** opened and stored in a dictionary.
- Each request accessed a fixed index in the dictionary (`GetLockedConnection`).
- If too few connections were initialized, errors occurred ("Key not found").

### Now:
- **No dictionary or startup loop anymore**: Connections are no longer held statically.
- **Connection Pooling**:  
  The MySQL connector now manages connections automatically.  
  The connection string includes something like `Pooling=true;Max Pool Size=100;`.
- **Dynamic opening and releasing**:  
  Each database access retrieves a connection from the pool (`using (var connection = new MySqlConnection(...))`) and returns it after use.
- **No errors due to missing indices**:  
  It doesnâ€™t matter how many parallel requests come in â€“ as long as the pool isnâ€™t full, each gets a connection.

## âœ… Benefits for You

- **No errors from index calculation or missing connections.**
- **Lower resource consumption**: Only the necessary number of connections are maintained.
- **Greater stability and scalability**: You can easily adjust the pool size in the connection string.
- **More maintainable code**: Less complexity, no manual management of connection objects.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

**Iâ€™ve transitioned from static, manual connection management to modern, automatic connection pooling.**  
The MoneyServer is now more efficient, stable, and capable of delivering better performance without overloading the database or producing index-related errors.
